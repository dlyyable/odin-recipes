       <p>Cajun seasoning and lime juice give plain grilled shrimp an upgrade. This would be the perfect pairing for some lemon basmati rice for a zesty summertime meal.</p>
       <p>Ingredients:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>3 tablespoons Cajun seasoning (such as Emeril's Essence)</li>
            <li>1 lime, juiced</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 pound peeled and deveined medium shrimp (30-40 per pound)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix together Cajun seasoning, lime juice, and oil in a resealable plastic bag. Add shrimp, coat with marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
            <li>Remove shrimp from marinade; shake off excess. Discard remaining marinade.</li>
            <li>Cook shrimp on the preheated grill until bright pink on the outside and the meat is no longer transparent in the center, about 2 minutes per side.</li>
        </ol>
